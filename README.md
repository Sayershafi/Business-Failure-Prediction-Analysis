# 🏦 Business Failure Prediction Analysis (FDIC + BLS Data)

📅 **Period:** 2000–2024  
🧠 **Tech Stack:** Python | Power BI | SQL | Pandas | Scikit-learn  

---

## 🎯 Objective
This project analyzes patterns and predicts business failures in the U.S. using **FDIC Failed Bank data** and **BLS Business Employment Dynamics (Business Survival Rates)**.  
The goal is to support data-driven insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers to mitigate financial risks and enhance economic resilience.

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **[FDIC Failed Bank List](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/)**  
  Contains historical bank closure data, including location, acquisition details, and failure causes.
- **[BLS Business Employment Dynamics – Business Survival Rates](https://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmage.htm)**  
  Tracks establishment openings, closures, and survival percentages by year and sector.

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation** – Cleaned and merged FDIC and BLS datasets.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Identified trends in bank failures and business survival rates.  
3. **Predictive Modeling** – Applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for failure prediction.  
4. **Visualization** – Designed a Power BI dashboard highlighting state-wise failures, trends, and survival patterns.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Businesses in finance, manufacturing, and retail sectors show distinct survival curves.  
- Strong correlation between macroeconomic factors and industry failure rates.  
- Predictive accuracy of **91%** achieved using XGBoost classifier.  
- Power BI visuals reveal recovery clusters and geographic concentration of failed institutions.
